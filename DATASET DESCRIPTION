The dataset which I have used for training set is based on data retrieved from Roads.
You can get the set from the following link:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+%28North+Jutland%2C+Denmar k%29#

The dataset was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2D road network in North Jutland, Denmark (covering a region of 185 x 135 km^2).
Elevation values where extracted from a publicly available massive Laser Scan Point Cloud for Denmark.
